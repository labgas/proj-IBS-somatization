# proj-IBS-somatization
Matlab code to calculate graph theoretical measures on brain structural connectivity data in IBS patients with high and low levels of somatic symptoms and healthy controls (Grinsvall et al, Brain Sci 2021; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11121580).\
Note that scripts require the [Brain Connectivity Toolbox](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) on your Matlab path.\
Scripts are written by and published courtesy of Patrick Dupont, PhD (Laboratory for Cognitive Neurology, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Belgium).
